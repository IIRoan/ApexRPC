# Note
Steam has added an delay or some sort of caching the page that is scraped to display the rich presence, while this means the program still works it doesnt update as frequently as before.
By my testing steam updates the page now every 7.5 minutes, kind of defeats the purpose but it still works.

# Apex Legends Discord rich presence

Displays a more fun version of rich presense for Apex, it translate your Steam activities into Discord, keeping your friends updated on your games.
